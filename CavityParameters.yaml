# We define Vrf, the revolution frequency of synchrotron, and the harmonic number at the top of the configuration file since these values are shared by every cavity
Vrf: 1.7d6 #in units of V
f0: 3.785d5     # in units of Hz (This is not angular frequency)
harmonic: 1320 # unitless
# we make a list of cavities with various properties
cavities:
# To define a new cavity, we go the the next line , indent 2 spaces, adding a - , and then type the name of the cavity
# On the immediate next line, indenting by 2 spaces and specifying it's type
# The possible types are
#   - "active"
#   - "passive"

# Afterwards, you need to specify numerical values of the parameters needed to define the voltage of the cavity
# all parameters need to be indented 2 spaces with respect to the cavity name

# For an active configuration, you need:
#  - r: relative voltage with respect to V_rf
#  - Phi: initial phase of voltage (in degrees)
#  - order: the order of the cavity

# For a passive configuration, you need:
#  - shunt impedance
#  - Phase of voltage
#  - order of cavity
# Below is an example defining the main cavity. This is an active cavity of order 1 with r=1 with sin(Phi) equal to the energy loss per turn
  - main1:
      type: "active"
      r: 1 # relative voltage (1 means same as mains voltage)
      n: 1
      Phase: 17 # Modify as needed to match energy loss per turn (U/(V_rf) where U is in units of eV)
# For a passive cavity, we swap relative voltage for shunt impedance
  - hhc1:
      type: "passive"
      shunt: 9.02d6 # shunt impedence in Mega Ohms
      n: 3
      Phase: 80.22 
# For a passive cavity, we swap relative voltage for shunt impedance
  - hhc2:
      type: "active"
      r: -0.5 # this means that the voltage is half the value of mains and opposite in signage
      n: 2
      Phase: 80.22
